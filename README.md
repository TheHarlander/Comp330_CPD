## Weekly Reports
During this term I will be keeping weekly reports to indentify weaknesses and skills I can improve on.

### Week 1 
The first week back had me excited to experience new things and have the chance to work in a big team to create a game. The new studio looked like it was going to be cold and loud and turned out to be just that. I was ready to get stuck into Unreal and being tasked to make a prototype let me do that. The early morning daily meetings were a struggle to get used as it was hard for everyone to be on time and be there. To make sure these meetings happen better,I would like to have better communication within the team. A slack group for late could be created so that the team can see who will not be in.

### Week 2 
Week 2 was mostly spent on unreal again and I managed to quickly make a prototype. This prototype was of a free running system which implemented a lot of collision spheres. I really enjoyed doing this as I could see the progress and everyone loved it. I also spent some time learning the hexadecimal for the legacy systems module. What I found hard this week was the planning of my work, making a structured plan will surely help me throughout this year. To make this happen I will need to do a few things. The first is to print out all assignment briefs and then create a due date poster which will have all major hand ins and all secondary hands ins. Doing this will help me visualize how to structure my time and I will want to do this within week 3 so that I will reap the full benefit from it.


### Week 3 
This week was nice as the team decided to use my prototype as the base for the game. This gave me a boost in work morale and I managed to do a lot more work on the system I’m creating. I found that I am lacking in reading material for my course, reading is a big part of learning and for my dissertation a wide array of literature is key for a good grade. I would like to set myself a minimum of 2 papers a week to read on selected areas mainly being my dissertation. During these readings I should write down notes on them so that I am able to recall at a later date.


### Week 4 
Things at home are becoming extremely unbearable so my work flow has slowed down significantly. Little to no work has been done. An informal improvement I can suggest to myself is to make sure to have healthy outside of work past times such as going home or spending time out of the house.


### Week 5-Week 6 
These weeks were almost blurred into one as things went bad at home and I could not do much.


### Week 7 
This week I spent a little time on my dissertation and a little bit trying to figure out the demake code,  the demake code has be baffled as I know what I want to do but putting into code is quite hard. Being stuck on the same piece of code for a while always has had knock on effects which result in me not doing work. If I were to spend an evening a week to learn 6502 instead of being stuck on my own code it would allow me to progress in my knowledge and not get too frustrated and not do any work.


### Week 8
This week was pretty tough as I hadn't done much on my dissertation. Spending everyday reading and working on it I was quite burnt and by the end of it I handed in a poor piece of work. A major improvement I would need to make is to have work every 2 weeks to show to my lecturer as per instructed. Even if it is a small amount it would help to steer me in the right direction and have more done every week. Setting myself to have 500-1000 words to show and also bring a notepad to write down all the feedback would be highly valuable.


### Week 9 
This week I was seriously ill because of food poisoning so I was unable to do any work as i was bedridden. This was the week I was going to spend to get my Demake to a good grade but because of my illness I couldn't do anything and had to upload a poor piece of work. I’m now worried about my overall grade and university. This could of been countered by just doing more before the week handin. Doing a little bit of work each day would allow it to be easily done and have progress throughout the year.

### Week 10
This week we got to work on the game solely but because I have been away for so long a lot of what I did has changed or been removed. Even though my work helped drive the project in the right direction to see so much not used was sad. Getting used to the project again was hard as so much was different and some things i had no clue what they did confused me. My improvement for the week would be to make sure that every week even if I have not worked on the project is to sit down with one of the programmers and go through what has changed and what things do.

### Week 11
This week has felt a lot better although not much work was done. Each day I would work on my poster and handout a little bit at a time, but this was better than nothing. What troubled me was when I asked for information about the game from the designers they didn't really know anything including market research and the core concepts of our game. I would like to in future to work on keeping a detailed brief and information about any project I work on in a group. I could achieve this by doing my own initial research in the first 2 weeks of a project and then confer with the heads of the team to make sure I have correct information.

### Week 12
This week it felt like my team was very rarely in as they were working on their essays. I managed to fix a bug within an hour of getting in when I had been stuck on it for a few day. This could be an improvement I could make, When stuck on a problem for a full day I should only work on it for an hour the next day. If then I still I can fix it put it to the side and come back to it a couple days later as a fresh set of eyes and ideas will help.
